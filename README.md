# SpaceLearn

### Objective

We live in an age of information, where acquiring new knowledge has become easier than ever before, through means such as Online Learning Platforms. In spite of this fact, traditional OLPs often provide one-size-fits-all content, which often falls short of the expectations that individual users have. Our objective is to create a high quality website, where users are free to learn any kind of subject they would wish to engage with. The website aims to do this through features such as:

1. Knowledge Assistant powered by AI
2. Goal Oriented Learning
3. Curated Content Recommendation 
4. AI-Generated Tests & Quizzes
5. Gamification & Engagement
