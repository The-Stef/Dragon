            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                Traditional OLPs often provide one-size-fits-all content, which often falls short of the expectations that individual users have.
                Unmet expectations can result in a plethora of issues for the users, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Frustration.</li>
                    <li>Disengagement with the content.</li>
                    <li>People might recommend against using your app to their mutuals.</li>
                </ul>
